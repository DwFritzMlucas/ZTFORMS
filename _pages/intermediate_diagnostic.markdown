The whole purpose regarding a Diagnostic Part Inspection Program (PIP) is to validate the performance of a tool in a standard way. Ideally, any Diagnostic should be easy to set up, outrageously repeatable, short in duration, and provide immediate data feedback. Our desire is to produce believable and useful performance data in a short amount of time.

Regarding Diagnostics, our approach is to measure a NIST traceable part(s) and compare the resulting data to what we know to be true. NIST (National Institute of Standards and technology) and the French BIPM (International Bureau of Weights and Measures) provide common measurement references. The fact that people around the world can reference a distance of 22.005 mm and mean **exactly** the same thing is primarily due to these agencies fullfilling their missions. Most NIST or BIPM parts we will use, will take the form of Gauge Blocks or Ring Gauges that have been referenced to these specific standards. From a ZeroTouch perspective, we consider dimensional values associated with these parts to be “true”. 

With that said, the links below will guid the user to some standard Diagnostics for Zerotouch tool evaluations.
